# FinalProject-ROH
Runs of homozygosity characterization in three bovine breeds
 
1. 	Overview and motivation
 Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are continuous homozygous segments of the DNA sequence in diploid genomes.  ROH patterns result from population phenomena such as genetic drift, population bottleneck, inbreeding, and intensive artificial selection, additionally can provide insight about population history and structure.
The identification of ROH hot spots is also used to find disease-causing genes that are generally recessive, preserve populations, and maintain genetic diversity in long-term animal breeding programs, while monitoring the inbreeding rate. It is also used to explore signatures of selection, considering that genomic regions sharing ROH potentially contain alleles associated with genetic improvement in livestock.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common type of genetic variation within the genome. Due to their high abundance in the genome, SNPs are used as the predominant marker type.  High-density SNP arrays have been used to identify ROH allowing comparison of the degree of homozygosity among populations.
The objective of this study is to identify and characterize homozygous segments present in the genome of three bovine breeds, as well as identify the most common genes shared in our samples and compare such genes according to physiological functions.

3. 	 Initial questions?
·        Are the ROH patterns/characterization similar between the breeds?
·        What are the most common genes within breeds, in our sample? Are such genes alike in the three bovine breeds?
 
4. 	Data
 The database used to carry out this study will come from the publicly accessible content provided by Web-Interfaced next generation Database dedicated to genetic Diversity (Sempéré et al., 2015), containing genotypic dataset from Holstein, Gyr and Hereford breeds. Genotyping assays with 50,000 SNPs (50k) from Illumina Bovine SNP50 v1 BeadChip.will be accessed.
